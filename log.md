### Day 1: March 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Pair programmed with Justine and Al

**Thoughts**: We went over arrays and objects in js, and how objects all start from zero

### Day 2: March 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started building structure for book cover artwork project, read a lot of articles, started working out a [code curriculum for 100 days of code](https://www.notion.so/thornes/100-Days-of-Code-Curriculum-874e72b904d64e6bb453a071ee971532)

**Thoughts:** The book cover project was super fun! I feel like a more experienced dev could whip this out in ten minutes, but I worked on it slowly over the course of the evening, and feel like it helped me get a really good grasp on elements, especially margin v. padding finally.

### Day 3: March 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Phew I did The Most today. Tried posting TV generator to Glitch but my java wasn't working, so worked on the book cover project instead. I read a lot of Tech Twitter and followed lots of inspiring women, and glanced around at some Glitch projects. Chatted with Rik at Superhi and desidoes.dev should be working soon. Other than that, I cleaned up desidoes.dev to start sharing it around, by adding the overlay in the digital portfolio section and fine-tuning the bio section. I also started the arduous task of organizing my hard drive which feels medal-worthy.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 4: March 6, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished through video 14/26 week 5 of Superhi Foundations, wrote the bulk of a draft on determining your dream job to post on dev.to and my portfolio blog, built a quick CakeResume and linked it from my profile, and played around in book cover project again

**Thoughts:** The Superhi classes are becoming a LOT for me to absorb at the end of the day when my brain feels fried, because mobile optimization is a new concept for me. I'll have to dedicate weekends for this, or do it earlier in the day.

### Day 5: March 7, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Mostly just read articles on dev.to, did some _tiny_ work on book covers project, and realigned something in TV gen. Asked for design Thursday feedback in Superhi #design Slack. 

**Thoughts:** I had a big frustrating day at work, so my bandwidth for anything was low.

### Day 7: March 9, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Read up on dev.to and some tutorials, worked on a book chapter proposal, wireframed new portfolio site.

**Thoughts:** I'm super excited at the possibility of this chapter but trying not to get too ahead of myself!

### Day 9: March 11, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I didn't do a lot today. Tidied up book chapter a bit, listed to CodeNewbie podcast, read up a bit.

**Thoughts:** Felt a bit braindead and Evan came home after a vacation, so spent time with him.

### Day 10: March 12, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Worked on book chapter, read on dev.to, and worked on book cover project. 

**Thoughts:** Super happy that I got the tilt on the Tell Me Lies h3s!

### Day 11: March 13, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Styled book cover project and added random book picker, finished book chapter!! Created a Glitch app to generate random names for things. 

**Thoughts:** I'm still so irritated that I can't seem to figure out how to style javascript results or the button itself, but I'm trying not to get too worked up or focused on this one thing. It would be cool to make the random name generator into an extension.

### Day 12: March 14, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Stylized the button in the book cover project, changed some css things there too. learned how to style console messages, so put one in the glitch generator.

**Thoughts:** There's a lot of CSS stuff that I'm starting to "get" so that's been exciting!

### Day 13: March 15, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Added some portfolio examples to Github and wrote userstories for it, sussed out portfolio page a bit more, posted an article on dev.to

**Thoughts:** I'm trying to figure out the best way to display examples of things like userstories. They don't seem super common on things like

### Day 14: March 16, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Today I went to the #WTM19 summit at Google. It was absolutely amazing. 
I also got in a fight with a Man on the Internet.

**Thoughts:** I look forward to more fully fleshing out my thoughts, but the tl;dr is that it was amazingly empowering, and made me realize that I know more than I thought.

### Day 15: March 17, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Tried finishing up lesson 5 on Superhi, but my javascript isn't working for some reason, and I got really fed up trying to get it to work. I commented on some dev.to articles, and started sketching out two further ideas. I also sent the first draft of the chapter off for proofing and editing! 

**Thoughts:** Fully learning javascript instead of just piecing things together is going to be really hard and frustrating.

**Today's Progress:** Asked for Justine's help on aligning my portfolio menu!!! Also set up the mobile breakpoints and I'm really liking how it's all turning out. Wrote a bit on dev.to.

### Day 22: March 27, 2019
**Today's progress:** Started working on random task generator - wrote out specs, drew a wireframe, and wrote out some pseudocode. I also did a preliminary HTML layout for the app.

**Thoughts**: In writing out everything I wanted to do, what seemed easy is starting to get a little complicated, whoops.

### Day 23: March 28, 2019
**Today's progress:** Finished(?) fleshing out the HTML/CSS structure for the app, and started on the jS. Got the to-do input sorted, and now I just have to learn how to make the second button pull from the input tasks.

**Thoughts:** I'm going to have to start reading up on some jquery documentation to finish this up, I think!

### Day 23: April 4, 2019
**Today's progress:** Ran through Codecademy command line tutorial, wireframed and started building [Reboot podcast site](http://alphanumeric.draft.superhi.com/index.html), attempted to install Gatsby, collected weekly articles to start a Best of DEV.to series. I also made and committed bug templates to the Bz repo which was scary but exciting. Over the last few days though I wasn't really actively coding, I've been practicing on the Codecademy app. Practiced a bit o' Flexbox Froggy.

**Thoughts**: I am very bad at terminal. I tried doing every step I could find to troubleshoot and fix and nothing came up the way I expected. But I'm understanding CSS a little better and the Reboot site was easy - had a little trouble figuring out what `div` to target to set the main body content full-height without any overbleed or shortness, but I thiiiiink I got it.
