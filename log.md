### Day 1: March 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Pair programmed with Justine and Al

**Thoughts**: We went over arrays and objects in js, and how objects all start from zero

### Day 2: March 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started building structure for book cover artwork project, read a lot of articles, started working out a [code curriculum for 100 days of code](https://www.notion.so/thornes/100-Days-of-Code-Curriculum-874e72b904d64e6bb453a071ee971532)

**Thoughts:** The book cover project was super fun! I feel like a more experienced dev could whip this out in ten minutes, but I worked on it slowly over the course of the evening, and feel like it helped me get a really good grasp on elements, especially margin v. padding finally.

### Day 3: March 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Phew I did The Most today. Tried posting TV generator to Glitch but my java wasn't working, so worked on the book cover project instead. I read a lot of Tech Twitter and followed lots of inspiring women, and glanced around at some Glitch projects. Chatted with Rik at Superhi and desidoes.dev should be working soon. Other than that, I cleaned up desidoes.dev to start sharing it around, by adding the overlay in the digital portfolio section and fine-tuning the bio section. I also started the arduous task of organizing my hard drive which feels medal-worthy.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 4: March 6, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished through video 14/26 week 5 of Superhi Foundations, wrote the bulk of a draft on determining your dream job to post on dev.to and my portfolio blog, built a quick CakeResume and linked it from my profile, and played around in book cover project again

**Thoughts:** The Superhi classes are becoming a LOT for me to absorb at the end of the day when my brain feels fried, because mobile optimization is a new concept for me. I'll have to dedicate weekends for this, or do it earlier in the day.

### Day 5: March 7, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Mostly just read articles on dev.to, did some _tiny_ work on book covers project, and realigned something in TV gen. Asked for design Thursday feedback in Superhi #design Slack. 

**Thoughts:** I had a big frustrating day at work, so my bandwidth for anything was low.

### Day 9: March 11, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I didn't do a lot today. Tidied up book chapter a bit, listed to CodeNewbie podcast, read up a bit.

**Thoughts:** Felt a bit braindead and Evan came home after a vacation, so spent time with him.

### Day 10: March 12, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Worked on book chapter, read on dev.to, and worked on book cover project.

### Day 11: March 13, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Styled book cover project and added random book picker, finished book chapter!! Created a Glitch app to generate random names for things. 

**Thoughts:** I'm still so irritated that I can't seem to figure out how to style javascript results or the button itself, but I'm trying not to get too worked up or focused on this one thing. It would be cool to make the random name generator into an extension.

### Day 12: March 14, 2019

**Today's Progress:** stylized the button in the book cover project, changed some css things there too. learned how to style console messages, so put one in the glitch generator.

**Thoughts:** There's a lot of CSS stuff that I'm starting to "get" so that's been exciting!
