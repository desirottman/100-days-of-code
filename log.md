### Day 1: March 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Pair programmed with Justine and Al

**Thoughts**: We went over arrays and objects in js, and how objects all start from zero

### Day 2: March 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started building structure for book cover artwork project, read a lot of articles, started working out a [code curriculum for 100 days of code](https://www.notion.so/thornes/100-Days-of-Code-Curriculum-874e72b904d64e6bb453a071ee971532)

**Thoughts:** The book cover project was super fun! I feel like a more experienced dev could whip this out in ten minutes, but I worked on it slowly over the course of the evening, and feel like it helped me get a really good grasp on elements, especially margin v. padding finally.

### Day 3: March 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Phew I did The Most today. Tried posting TV generator to Glitch but my java wasn't working, so worked on the book cover project instead. I read a lot of Tech Twitter and followed lots of inspiring women, and glanced around at some Glitch projects. Chatted with Rik at Superhi and desidoes.dev should be working soon. Other than that, I cleaned up desidoes.dev to start sharing it around, by adding the overlay in the digital portfolio section and fine-tuning the bio section. I also started the arduous task of organizing my hard drive which feels medal-worthy.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 4: March 6, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished through video 14/26 week 5 of Superhi Foundations, wrote the bulk of a draft on determining your dream job to post on dev.to and my portfolio blog, built a quick CakeResume and linked it from my profile, and played around in book cover project again

**Thoughts:** The Superhi classes are becoming a LOT for me to absorb at the end of the day when my brain feels fried, because mobile optimization is a new concept for me. I'll have to dedicate weekends for this, or do it earlier in the day.
